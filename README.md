# TechPulse — Frontend

Frontend application for TechPulse, a structured AI platform for company intelligence,
talent assessment, and market trend analysis.

This repository contains the **frontend layer only**.

All AI logic, inference, governance rules, and decision-making are implemented
server-side and maintained in private repositories.

---

## Overview

The TechPulse frontend is responsible for:

- User interaction and input collection
- Visualization of structured, governance-qualified outputs
- Navigation across analysis and prediction modules
- Presentation of insights generated by backend services

The frontend does **not** perform inference, scoring, or decision-making.

---

## Capabilities (UI Perspective)

The user interface provides access to the following backend capabilities:

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Company Analysis | Risk and opportunity assessments |
| Trend Analysis | Market signals and emerging patterns |
| Predictions | Structured forecasts with explicit constraints |
| Talent Intelligence | Skills and positioning insights |
| Reality Check | Validation-oriented structured outputs |

All outputs are rendered exactly as returned by backend services.

---

## Architecture

TechPulse follows a **strict separation of concerns**.

| Layer | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Frontend (this repository) | UI, input handling, visualization |
| Backend Services (private) | Validation, orchestration, inference |
| Governance Layer | Output qualification and contract enforcement |

The frontend receives **only qualified outputs**.  
No raw model responses or ungoverned data are exposed to the UI.
